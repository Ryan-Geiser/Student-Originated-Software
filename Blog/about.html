      <p>
        My name is Ryan Geiser. I live out in Olympia, Washington with my cat Sasha.

      <p>
        Currently I'm working on getting my Bachelor's of Science at The Evergreen State College. 
        Besides school, I enjoy playing games, listening to music, bouldering, playing my bass and 
        playing with my cat Sasha. 
      </p>

          I am the 1%. For the past 4 years, I've listened to more music on Spotify that 99% of people in North America.
